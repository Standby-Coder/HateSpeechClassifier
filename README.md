<h1>Hate Speech Classifier</h1>

Objective - Classify a sentence,comment from Twiiter or a post from Reddit into hate speech or offensive language or neither of them.

Dataset taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset

Data from the dataset is small to train on and moreover it is slightly unbalanced making it difficult to train on.

The model uses Google's BERT to train on the dataset and it achieves good performance despite the small dataset.

Let's see if we can complete the bigger project using this :P
